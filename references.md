# References

(under construction)

My notes contain everything that is needed for the course and a bit more. There are also many references integrated in the text.

## General background

The best general book on computing must be (let me know if you have other suggestions) [Goedel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GÃ¶del,_Escher,_Bach). This book is fun, about music, art and computing. It will leave with a much deeper understanding of what computing "is", and you will find many themes that appear in this course presented in a very different way.

## History

...

## Technical background

[Termrewriting](https://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/TRaAT/). This is the book I used to prepare much of the material on ARSs and termrewriting.

...

## Haskell

[Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction) is an online tutorial on Haskell. It really starts out with the basics and is written in a style that should make it easy to follow along and also to experiment with your own variations of the examples presented. 

[Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) provides documentation of Haskell libraries.

## Special Topics

A blog on [dynamical vs lexical scoping](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/blog/2019/09/05/lexical-and-dynamic-scope/).

## Writing Parsers and Interpreters

Some references here that contain ideas for projects related to the course.

### Prolog

Haskell is a good language to implement an interpreter, but [Prolog]() also is. Could be a fun project to develop the Assignments in Prolog and see how it compares.

### Scheme

Here is an [Interpreter for Lambda Calculus in Scheme](http://matt.might.net/articles/implementing-a-programming-language/). Looks cool as well and is not too far from the Haskell one. Could be a fun project to develop the Assignments in Scheme and see how it compares.
