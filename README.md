# programming-languages-2019

Notes for the **Programming Languages** course at Chapman University 2019.

The course wil have a practical and a theoretical component.

- *The theoretical component* will teach some of the discrete mathematics that forms the background to understand principles of programming languages. These include the very basics of logic, rewriting, ordered structures, universal algebra, type theory, etc. 

- *The practical component* will be about building a small programming language. We will start with the smallest practical programming language known as lambda calculus and then extend it with features. There will be room for invention and adventure there if you feel like it. But there will also be guided exercises.

**Assesment:** The theoretical component will be assessed by a final exam worth 30% and a number of tests during the semester worth together 20%. The practical component will be assessed by a short essay and presentation worth 20% and a number of programming exercises during the semester worth together 30%.

**Creating our own little programming language** will be an important part of the course. This will involve using the tool BNFC as well as learning some of the programming Haskell. 

**Haskell** is the leading functional programming language and will be of interest to the course for a number of reasons:

 - Haskell can be considered as a domain specific language for creating programming languages.
 
 - Haskell is the langauge in which many tools (such as BNFC) in the area of Programming Languages is implemented.
 
 - Haskell is a lazy functional programming language and a prime example of an important paradigm in Programming Languages.
 
 - Haskell is an elaboration of the lambda calculus, which also forms the basis for our own small programming language.
 
 - Haskell is the language in which we will write the interpeter used to execute our programming language.
 
 - Haskell's semantics is based on rewriting, which forms one of the central theoretical concept of the course.
 
 - Haskell is gaining popularity in industry applications for a number of important reasons, such as self-documenting code, a strong type system, side-effect free parallelizable code, ...
