The aim of the course is to have a look under the hood of programming languages. How do programming languages work? Could you design your own programming language? Instead of looking at particular examples of programming languages, we will build our own. It will be small and not efficient, but we will be able to understand in all detail how it works. The principles we learn apply to  industrial scale programming languages such as C++ as we will see in more detail in the sequel course of Compiler Construction next semester.

Prerequisites: I assume that you know at least one, ideally a few more, programming languages. It would also be good to have learned something about computer architecture. The topic of the course is how to bridge the gap between a programming language and the actual machine, so some awareness of how actual machines work is needed to fully appreciate the material. Finally, I will introduce all the  mathematics that we used to engineer programming languages, but some ability in manipulating formal mathematical models as typically aquired in a discrete mathematics course will be needed.
