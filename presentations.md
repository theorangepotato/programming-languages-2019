# Essay and Presentations

Form groups of 3-4 students

Choose a programming language (not Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, ... 
unless you want to dig into an interesting not widely known feature of these languages)

Let me know via [email using this link](mailto:akurz@chapman.edu?subject=CPSC-354-Presentations) by Friday Nov 1 your groups and choice of programming language

Each group will get approx 15 min for the presentation. The essay should be 1 to 2 pages long and include at least information about
- why you chose the programming language
- a bit of history of the programming language
- for what kinds of tasks the language is particularly suitable
- some example of where it is used successfully
- why I should consider the language to implement which task
- some features you found particularly interesting

and be distributed to the audience as a handout.
