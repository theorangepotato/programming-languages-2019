To compile run `stack build` and to launch the REPL, run `stack exec lamfun`. For help, type `:help` in the REPL...

The full grammar of Î»Fun is given below:

```
<statement> ::= <expr> ";;" | <defn> ";;"
<defn>      ::= "val" <id> "=" <expr> | "rec" <id> " " <ids> "=" <expr>
<expr>      ::= <id> | 
                <number> | 
                "true" | 
                "false" | 
                "\" <ids> "." <expr> | 
                <expr> " " <expr> | 
                <expr> <op> <expr> | 
                "[" <list> "]" | 
                <expr> ":" <expr> |
                "let " <defn> " in " <expr> | 
                "case " <expr> " of " "{" <case> "}" |
