# Logical Reasoning

(under construction)

## Introduction

We will learn how the formal laws of logic can be helpul for informal reasoning.

We draw the running example from the theoretical part of the course, but the same method applies to any kind of reasoning, for example, to debugging code or finding out why some software fails to install properly on our machines.

## Example

We have learned the following:

terminating implies normalising

An ARS has unique normal forms if (and only if) it is confluent and normalising.

If an ARS is confluent and terminating then all elements reduce to a unique normal form.

Let (𝐴,→) be a finitely branching ARS. The ARS is terminating if and only if there is a measure function 𝜙:𝐴→ℕ .

Let us abbreviate these statement to highlight their logical structure

    T => NF
    C & NF <=> UNF
    C & T => UNF
    FB => (T <=> MFN)
    
## Learning via Reasoning

We can combine the above ingredients to form many statements. How can we find out which are true and which are wrong?

The logical method is a two pronged approach. To use the laws of logic to derive new results from what we already knwo to be true. And to find counterexamples for what we suspect might be wrong.

Let us take the two in turns.
